Welcome to my Node/Express navigation Bar assignment!
This assignment allows you to use a navBar and interact with the 3 buttons, depending on the button you select it'll redirect you to the github repository for that assignment! cool right !
To use it follow these steps:
Follow The Link and just click one of the Links!

  If you would like to clone this project for your own needs follow these steps:
  -create a node project using "npm init -y"
  -install express using npm install express
  -Start you server in the terminal using "node server.js"( or whatever you named your js file)
  -finally using some js skill, add some routes that can redirect the user once they've clicked on any respective link that they have added to their html code such as (app.get("/your-Link-endpoint in the html code", (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('Link to send the user once clicked');
});
  
Just Like that you have used the exact tech stack I used to create this project being node and express.
